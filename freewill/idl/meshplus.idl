/// @defgroup meshplus MESH+ Module
/// An abstract layer for the Meshes:
///
/// - IMesh objects are used to create 3D animated meshes,
/// constructed of a number of vertices and faces.
/// - The IMeshBuffer and its derivatives, IMeshVertexBuffer and IMeshFaceBuffer,
/// provide underlying hardware buffers.
/// - IMeshDictionary object used for mapping bone names to indices
///
/// \remark
/// The most common situation is when you load a Scene or a Scene Meshed Object from a file
/// (see IFileLoader::LoadScene, IFileLoader::LoadObject). All the needed meshes will be then 
/// created and initialised automatically. 
///
/// \section BufSection Buffer Creation and Usage
/// Buffers (IMeshVertexBuffer and IMeshFaceBuffer specialised interfaces) provide indispensable
/// link for the Meshes to the underlying low-level systems (eg. DirectX, OGL). 
/// They are highly platform-dependent components and therefore are implemented in RENDER+ module 
/// (see FWRender::MeshDX9VertexBuffer and FWRender::MeshDX9FaceBuffer). 
/// They should never be created directly. Instead, use IRndrGeneric::GetVertexBuffer 
/// and IRndrGeneric::GetFaceBuffer functions that create them. The creation process is two-stage, 
/// and must involve further call to IMeshVertexBuffer::Create and IMeshFaceBuffer::Create, respectively.
/// \remark The actual data format of the created buffers may differ from what was requested,
/// depending on the local system capabilities. Call IMeshVertexBuffer::GetFormat or
/// IMeshFaceBuffer::GetFormat to verify the actual format.
///
/// Once the buffer is created, any low-level operations should be preceded with a call to 
/// IMeshBuffer::Open and terminated with a call to IMeshBuffer::Close. Putting or modifying 
/// the buffer raw data is generally the user's responsibility and should be done using 
/// the pointer got during opening, however in the IMesh interface one can find
/// a bundle of usefull facility functions.
/// \remark When acting with the beuufer data directly, use IMeshVertexBuffer::GetFormat,
/// IMeshVertexBuffer::GetCaps and IMeshFaceBuffer::GetFormat to determine the data layout.
///
/// \section MeshSection The Mesh Object (IMesh)
/// The IMesh objects together with a kinematical skeleton (KinePlus::KineBone) are put together
/// into a ISceneObject object to form a fully functional object ready for rendering.
/// Most often you will create IMesh objects with a ISceneObject::NewMesh facility function.
/// In case you create mesh on your own call ISceneObject::AddMesh to include the mesh
/// into the Scene Meshed Object and to initialise it accordingly.
///
/// The IMesh object needs to be initialised with IMeshVertexBuffer and IMeshFaceBuffer buffers
/// as well as IMeshDictionary, however both ISceneObject::NewMesh and ISceneObject::AddMesh functions
/// will do this initialisation for you.
///
/// The IMesh usage involves opening the raw data with IMesh::Open, filling the data and closing the buffers
/// with IMesh::Close. For filling the data, a broad range of format-independent
/// easy-to-use functions is provided. Alternatively (faster!) you can set data directly 
/// in the buffer bytes (see \ref BufSection). 
///
/// \subsection MeshGen General Data Support
/// General Data Support (GDS) is a set of functions that allow quick and easy setting 
/// the xyz, colouring, point size and texture attributes for vertices as well as 
/// index triples for faces without bothering with the actual buffer format. 
/// Call IMesh::Open before use.
/// \sa IMesh::SetVertexXYZ and following functions.
///
/// \subsection MeshNor Normal Vector Support
/// Normal Vector Support (NVS) allows setting the normal vectors for vertices; an important facility
/// is that two or more normals per vector are allowed. This usually happens when a vertex 
/// is shared by two or more neighbouring smoothing areas, and forms a part of a 3d edge.
/// It is essential to notice that a completely separate copy of a vertex (a clone) is
/// created in the vertex buffer for each separate value of the normal vector. Therefore
/// the vertex index may be changed during the IMesh::AddNormal call, and consequently
/// it has been defined as an [in, out] param. When storing vertex indices 
/// as triangle definitions in the face buffer it is critical to call AddNormal first 
/// so that to use the appropriate clone, i.e. with the normal value used in the given
/// face and the smoothing area. Notice, that several calls for the same vertex/normal pair
/// will not lead to any redundant data.
/// \remark
/// - To start using the NVS functionality, first call IMesh::SupportNormal
/// - Then use IMesh::AddNormal to store normals.
/// - NVS may allocate large temporary data structures (created by SupportBlendWeight, released by Close)
/// - As use of NVS clones some vertices, it will lead to increasing the length of the
/// used vertex buffer (IMesh::GetVertexNum), and occasionally may cause the 
/// \ref FW_E_MEMOVERRUN error.
///
/// \subsection MeshVer Vertex Blending Support
/// Vertex Blending Support (VBS) enables use of a single mesh spread on a number of bones.
/// Vertices of such mesh may be controlled by two or more bones (blended control), 
/// with a weight assigned to each bone. You simply pass a set of bone weight/bone name pairs
/// for each vertex, and VBS will translate the bone names to unique indices/ids using
/// an IMeshDictionary object provided. Use the same dictionary instance for several meshes
/// to keep consistency in bone ids. 
/// \remark
/// - To start using the VBS functionality, first call IMesh::SupportBlendWeight
/// - Then use IMesh::AddBlendWeight.
/// - VBS may allocate large temporary data structures (created by SupportBlendWeight, released by Close)
/// - As use of VBS occasionally causes new vertices to be created, it may lead to the \ref FW_E_MEMOVERRUN error.
/// - see also the \ref MeshSub section below.
///
/// \subsection MeshSub Submeshes
/// Some hardware platforms do not support bone indices; similar situation occurs when 
/// \ref MESH_VERTEX_BONEWEIGHT but not \ref MESH_VERTEX_BONEINDEX buffer creation flags are applied.
/// Subsequently only a limited set of globally defined bones may be used per mesh.
/// If necessary, the VBS engine (see the \ref MeshVer above) will divide and sort vertices into several submeshes,
/// so that not to exceed the allowed number of bones in each submesh. This facility is implemented
/// in IMesh::Close and may significantly increase the execution time of this function.
/// Creation of submeshes significantly affects the way in which the mesh should be rendered (see below).
///
/// \subsection MeshRndr Remarks on Mesh Rendering
/// The Vertex and Face Buffer, initialised with data and finalised with IMesh::Close call
/// are the general basis for rendering. However the use of Vertex Blending Support with Submeshes
/// (see IMesh::MeshSub) may cause that multiple, relatively small submeshes shuld be rendered rather
/// than the whole mesh. All the submeshes share the same Vertex/Face Buffers. First call
/// IMesh::SupportsSubmeshedVertexBlending to check if this is the case; if positive, call
/// IMesh::GetSubmeshInfo to collect details on submesh division.
///
/// \section MeshImpl Implementation Remarks
/// Vertex and Face Buffers are highly platform-dependent objects and are not implemented
/// in the FreeWill+ module. See the external implementation classes 
/// FWRender::MeshDX9VertexBuffer and FWRender::MeshDX9FaceBuffer.
///
/// The Mesh implementation is platform-independent and unlikely to be replaced 
/// in the future extensions, see FreeWillPlus::Mesh, so is the auxiliary class
/// FreeWillPlus::MeshDictionary.
